### Leo Breiman, “Statistical Modeling: The Two Cultures” (http://www2.math.uu.se/~thulin/mm/breiman.pdf)  
- Two cultures in statistical modeling to produce or reach conclusions; (1) stochastic models (assuming randomly generated data according to a probability distribution- think traditional statistics), and (2) algorithmic modelling that disregards the data generating mechanism.
- 98% of statisticians use (1), but many people use (2) for applying statistics to other field, and industry. This is what most ML falls into as well.
